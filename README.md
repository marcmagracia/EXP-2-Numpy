## Experiment 2: Numerical Python 
This is the second of several repositories I will upload to document my progress in Python programming through several exercises I am and will be performing. This repository has four (4) supplementary files that includes one 'README' file, one compilation of the problems in one python notebook file, and two .npy files for each problems. In this project, I used Numerical Python (Numpy) in creating programs intended to solve problems involving arrays.

Given problems and their expected outputs:

##### 1. Normalization Problem: 
Normalization is one of the most basic preprocessing techniques in data analytics. This involves centering and scaling process. Centering means subtracting the data from the mean and scaling means dividing with its standard deviation. Mathematically, normalization can be expressed as: Z = (ùëã‚àíùë•) / ùúé
In Python, element-wise mean and element-wise standard deviation can be obtained by using .mean() and .std() calls. In this problem, create a random 5 x 5 ndarray and store it to variable X. Normalize X.

##### 2. Divisible by 3 Problem: 
Create a 10 x 10 array that lists the squares of the first 100 positive integers. From this ndarray, determine all the elements that are divisible by 3.
